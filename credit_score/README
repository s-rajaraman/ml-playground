# Credit Score Predictor
##Background 
This dataset is from UCI ML Repository.

It contains 20 features and the target is whether the customer is good or bad.

This dataset is simple because there is no missing data, and most features can be converted to numeric values. Also, the set is small enough to use bash to preprocess the text, 


## Todos
* Preprocess the data
* Split the data into training and testing set
* Build a data pipeline for the network (even though this is really small dataset)
* Build a NN using TF
* Update this README with results
